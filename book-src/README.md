Bounce is a state-management library focusing on simplicity and
performance.

Bounce is inspired by [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and
[Recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil).

## Rationale

Yew state management solutions that are currently available all have
some (or all) of the following limitations:

- Too much boilerplate.

   Users either have to manually control whether to notify
   subscribers or have to manually define contexts.

- State change notifies all.

   State changes will notify all subscribers.

- Needless clones.

   A clone of the state will be produced for all subscribers whenever
there's a change.

Bounce wants to be a state management library that:

- Has minimal boilerplate.

   Changes are automatically detected via `PartialEq`.

- Only notifies relevant subscribers.

   When a state changes, only hooks that subscribe to that state will
be notified.

- Reduces Cloning.

   States are `Rc`'ed.

## Installation

If you have [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)
installed,
you can add it to your project with the following command:

```shell
cargo add bounce
```

You can also add it to the `Cargo.toml` of your project manually:

```toml
bounce = "0.4"
```
